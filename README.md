# unet

- `unet.py` contains pytorch model.
- `train_unet3class_pytorch.ipynb` is used for training the model.
- `test_unet3class_pytorch.ipynb` is used to test on unseen data.
- `debug_torch_version4.0-4.1.ipynb` is used for cleaning up `state_dict` in the initially trained model so that the edited model can be used for testing.
